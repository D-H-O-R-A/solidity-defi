// In this example, the ERC1155 token is derived from the SafeERC1155 contract from the OpenZeppelin library, which provides added security features such as protection against reentrancy and protection against overflow and underflow attacks. The DECIMALS constant is set to 18, which represents the number of decimal places in the token's value. The mint function can only be called by the owner of the contract, and the transfer function includes a check to ensure that the transfer is valid before executing it.
