//This implementation extends the SafeERC721 contract from OpenZeppelin, which provides a secure implementation of the ERC721 standard. The MyToken contract has functions for minting, transferring, and querying ownership of tokens. It also keeps track of the total supply and the ownership of each individual token through the _tokenOwners mapping.
//This is just an example, and it is recommended to thoroughly test and audit any contract before deployment to the mainnet. Additionally, security risks and vulnerabilities can change over time, so it's important to stay up-to-date with best practices and new developments in the Ethereum ecosystem.
